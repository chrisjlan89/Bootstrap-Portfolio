		<p> My name is Chris I am a hard-working goal oritented person with a constant desire to improve myself. I am taking this course because I want to improve my skill set and better myself for the futre. More importantly, however, I wish to challenge myself. So far the gas pedal has been all the way down. This course will be a rigorous test for sure, but after those moments of pure defeat will come overwheming pride and elation. I've always been fascinated by computers though I've been more inclined towards the hardware side. I always found coding intimidating and never knew where to start, though this site is starting to ease my doubt. 
I enjoy music and Video Games. My favorite game series is hard to pick but I'd probably have to go with the Legend of Zelda series. I love being outside and drinking craft beer, though to really keep up on the workload of this class I will surely have to cut back my consumption. I also really enjoy working out and running, kinda counter-intuitve to drink beer I know... I work out to drink, heh.I am particualrly enjoying IPAs at the moment. I really do enjoy a glass or two to appreciate the taste.   </p>
